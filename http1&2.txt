Difference between HTTP1 vs HTTP2

*HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information
*The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997 Because it went through several stages of development this first version of HTTP was called HTTP1
*HTTP1 loads resources one after the other  so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it
*HTTP2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource                            blocks any other resource   
*HTTP2 does this by splitting data into binary-code messages
*HTTP1 loads resources one after the other so if one resource cannot be loaded it blocks all the other resources behind it
 In contrast HTTP2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource    blocks any other resource
